const players = new Collection.Player();

// Search players
players.setQuery({ q: 'Matt' });
await players.fetch();

const beacon = new Model.Beacon({
    latitude: 40.7128,
    longitude: -74.0060,
    message: 'Looking for a game!'
});
await beacon.save();

// Delete beacon (stop broadcasting)
await beacon.destroy();
```
