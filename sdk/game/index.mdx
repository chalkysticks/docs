The `sdk-game` package provides physics simulation and game logic for the trainer.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @chalkysticks/sdk-game
```

## Quick Start

```typescript
import * as Game from '@chalkysticks/sdk-game';

// Game configuration
const config = {
    gameType: '8ball',
    tableDimensions: { width: 2540, height: 1270 }
};
```

## Exports

```typescript
import { Collection, Model, Factory, Utility } from '@chalkysticks/sdk-game';
```

## Game Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `8ball` | Standard 8-ball rules |
| `9ball` | 9-ball rotation |
| `10ball` | 10-ball (called pocket) |
| `3ball` | 3-ball speed game |
| `custom` | Custom game setup |

## Key Concepts

- **Physics Engine** handles ball dynamics, collisions, friction
- **Ball Manager** tracks ball states and positions
- **Shot Executor** handles power, english, elevation
- **Racking** provides standard and custom rack patterns
- **Foul Detector** enforces game rules
