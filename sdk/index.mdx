## Architecture

The SDK is a monorepo with a unified `ChalkySticks` namespace that aggregates all packages.

```typescript
import * as ChalkySticks from '@chalkysticks/sdk';

// Access any package via namespace
ChalkySticks.Core
ChalkySticks.Pad
ChalkySticks.Game
ChalkySticks.Venues
ChalkySticks.Players
ChalkySticks.TV
ChalkySticks.Authentication
ChalkySticks.Extras
```

| `@chalkysticks/sdk` | 1.60.9 | Main aggregator package |

## Installation

```bash
# Full SDK (recommended)
npm install @chalkysticks/sdk

# Or individual packages
npm install @chalkysticks/sdk-core @chalkysticks/sdk-pad
```

## Standard Exports

Each package follows this pattern:

```typescript
export * as Collection from './Collection'
export * as Model from './Model'
export * as Factory from './Factory'
export * as Enum from './Enum'
export * as Utility from './Utility'
```

## Namespace Structure

```typescript
ChalkySticks.Collection.*      // All collections
ChalkySticks.Model.*           // All models
ChalkySticks.Factory.*         // All factories
ChalkySticks.Enum.*            // All enumerations
ChalkySticks.Constants         // Global constants
ChalkySticks.Environment       // Environment config
ChalkySticks.Exception         // Exception classes
ChalkySticks.Utility           // Core utilities
```

## Build Outputs

Each package provides:
- **ESM:** `build/esm/index.js`
- **CJS:** `build/cjs/index.cjs`
- **Web Bundle:** `build/web/chalkysticks-*.js`
