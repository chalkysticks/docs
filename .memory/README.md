# ChalkySticks Documentation Memory

This folder contains reference files for Claude to quickly understand the ChalkySticks ecosystem when working on documentation.

---

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [project-paths.md](project-paths.md) | All project paths, versions, and purposes |
| [sdk-architecture.md](sdk-architecture.md) | SDK namespace structure and dependencies |
| [api-endpoints.md](api-endpoints.md) | Laravel API endpoint quick reference |
| [vue-ecosystem.md](vue-ecosystem.md) | Vue frameworks and applications |
| [checkpoints.md](checkpoints.md) | Documentation milestones for diff tracking |

---

## Usage

When starting a documentation session, reference these files to:
1. Know exact paths to explore
2. Understand architecture without re-exploring
3. Track what's been documented vs. pending
4. Compare changes between checkpoints

## Documentation Style Notes

From Matt's preferences:
- Vue 2.7 / TypeScript / vue-property-decorators (class-based)
- Use `v-bind`, `v-on` (not shorthand)
- Docblock comments for classes, functions, properties
- CSS/JS properties listed alphabetically
- No shorthand/longhand mixing in JS objects
- This is personal reference docs, not "Getting Started" guides
- Focus on practical examples like "How do I add balls to a table?"
